## Gameplay

In Flappy Bird, the objective is to navigate the bird through the gaps between pipes. The player taps the screen (or presses a key) to make the bird flap its wings and gain altitude. The bird falls due to gravity when not flapping. The game is over if the bird hits a pipe or the ground. The goal is to achieve the highest score by passing as many pipes as possible.
